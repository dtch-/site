        <h3>Crux as a daily driver</h3>
            <p><a href="http://crux.nu/">Crux</a> is a source-based linux distro. All utilities must be compiled, including the kernel. 
            While it may seem daunting for someone who's unfamiliar with the process, it's actually quite simple. The general crux workflow 
            is as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>Install package(pkg) x</li>
                <li>Pkg x isn't ported</li>
                <li>Create a port</li>
                <li>Run the program</li>
                <li>refer to step 1</li>
            </ol>
            Creating a port is fairly simple if you have the proper utilities. Z3bra has created <a href="http://git.z3bra.org/cgit.cgi/scripts/tree/prtmk">`prtmk`</a> 
            for use within crux. You can view it in action <a href="http://blog.z3bra.org/img/2014-05-26-prtutils.gif">here</a>. As well, 
            <a href="http://sprunge.us/JGIM/">here</a> is the pkgfile template needed for use with prtmk.</p>

            <p class="it">Why use crux?</p>
                <p>I used crux for a little over a week before being upset with it. First, let me just say that I absolutely understand the usability and need for a 
                source-based distro. Crux is simple to use, powerful in the right hands, and raw.  You make crux with your bare hands.</p>
                <p>That being said, I had problems with crux. Mainly due to some packages not wanting to work, even though they work perfectly on Arch. For example, 
                alsa-utils and mpd. MPD would not start, spewing errors of missing config files despite them being there. Alsa would simply state that there was no 
                such file or directory when running `alsamixer`, which I found no fix for. Personally, the bad outweighed the good in crux for me.</p>
            <p class="it">My experience</p>
                <p>As I said, the bad outweighed the good. I ultimately retired back to Arch. However, as I used crux I found new respect for source-based distros. 
                Using `prtmk` and `prt-get` felt good, natural, as though it was how a distro was meant to be. If I had an extra computer lying about, or just more 
                time in my day, I would definitely install crux again and try to get it working right.</p>
            <p class="it">Just try it</p>
                <p>Don't simply take my word. If you enjoy distro-hopping and messing with everything, install crux on a secondary computer or in a VM. It's really 
                a great distro. There is a handbook that literally walks you through the entire process of getting and burning the ISO to compiling the kernel and 
                nearly gets you to X.</p>
            <p class="it">In closing</p>
                <p>I would give crux a 7/10 (whereas Arch receives 8/10) simply due to the problems I've had with it. If I'd had no problems, it would definitely 
                be a 9/10 for me. If you enjoy source-based distros, or want to be a programmer (and want a matching distro), give it a shot. Just make sure to 
                get the new kernel, as crux 3.1 (current version as of writing) ships with 3.12.24 and the latest is 3.17.6 (stable).</p>
