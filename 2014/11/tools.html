        <h3>Tools</h3>
            <h4>2014, Nov. 16</h4>
            <p>All users have certain tools that they love and certain ones that
            they would rather bury. I'm going to go over the list of tools I use
            and why. This includes text editor, document reader, music player, 
            irc client, and much more.</p>
            
        <p class="ul bd">Text Editor: vim</p>
            <p>Vim has been my editor from day 1 and I can always count on it. 
            That being said, I have tried other text editors so that I don't 
            get caught up in just one. A few reasons why I love vim: it's simple, 
            it's fast, and it's easily customized.</p>
        <p class="ul bd">Music Player: ncmpcpp</p>
            <p>For my main music player, I prefer ncmpcpp. I've only recently 
            switched to it. Before, I was using moc. I prefer ncmpcpp over 
            moc because of the better features and the ncurses ui.</p>
        <p class="ul bd">Document Viewer: mupdf</p>
            <p>I chose mupdf as my document viewer because it is lightweight and 
            I do not need any features other than simply viewing the pdf file. Mupdf 
            is as it says, 'mu' (micro). It weighs in at just under 9MB in my /usr/bin.</p>
        <p class="ul bd">Terminal Emulator: rxvt-unicode</p>
            <p>Out of the other terms I've tried, I prefer urxvt most. xterm, terminator, 
            rxvt, just didn't cut it for me. I love the unicode features and the 256colors. 
            And, as always, the ability to customize it is a big plus.</p>
        <p class="ul bd">Shell: zsh</p>
            <p>I can't say I truly 'prefer' zsh over others as the only other shell 
            I've used is bash. However, zsh has all that I really need and I haven't 
            had a reason to try anything else.</p>
        <p class="ul bd">IRC Client: weechat</p>
           <p>As with other items on the list, I haven't tried many other IRC clients. 
            I did use irssi for a while, but I couldn't say that I enjoyed it any more 
            than I do weechat. My simple reason for using weechat is that it's easier 
            to customize than irssi is.</p>
        <p class="ul bd">Summary:</p>
            <p>In closing, most of the tools I use are simply because I've either used 
            them since I first touched linux or because they can be easily customized. 
            Perhaps, in time, I will have a better reasoning.</p>
