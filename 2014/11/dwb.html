        <h3>dwb</h3>
            <h4>2014, Nov. 17</h4>
                <p>I first heard of dwb through <a href="http://www.z3bra.org">z3bra</a> on #nixers. I saw it through his 
                screenshots and decided that it was time to try it out. Switching over 
                from firefox was easy enough as dwb behaves similar to firefox with 
                vimperator installed. One thing I do miss is RES. 
                I'm not even sure if dwb has support for plugins or not.</p>
            <p class="it">What is dwb?</p>
                <p>"<a href="http://portinx.bitbucket.org/dwb/">dwb</a> is a lightweight webkit browser 
                that is highly customisable and can easily be configured through a web 
                interface. It is mostly keyboard driven and is inspired by firefox's 
                vimperator plugin" -- A paraphrase of the 'about' section from the site.</p>
            <p class="it">Why use dwb?</p>
                <p>I first started using dwb (among other things) to see how well I could 
                get around without using a physical mouse. After a few days of use, I 
                realized that I enjoy it more than firefox, even sans plugins. Why? Aside 
                from being based off of vimperator, dwb is much more lightweight than firefox 
                and loads very quickly. As well, I feel it is easier to customise than 
                vimperator.</p>
            <p class="it">Why should I use dwb?</p>
                <p>You shouldn't. Not if you don't want to. If you're a vim* user, you'll 
                probably enjoy it. I do. I also have some complaints about it, such as the 
                lack of plugins or the inability to play a .webm but they're fairly minor 
                complaints. If I want to open a .webm, I can simply save it and open it up 
                in mplayer.</p>
            <p class="it">In Summary...</p>
                <p>I would definitely recommend you to at least try dwb. If you don't like 
                it, you can simply remove it and be done. If you do like it, then at least 
                I did some good today.</p>
